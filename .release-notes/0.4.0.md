## Fix potential connection hang when timer event subscription fails

On some platforms, if the operating system cannot allocate resources for a connection timer (e.g., ENOMEM on kqueue or epoll), connections could hang silently instead of reporting an error. Timer subscription failures are now detected and reported as connection failures.

## Require ponyc 0.63.1 or later

github_rest_api now requires ponyc 0.63.1 or later. Older ponyc versions are no longer supported.
